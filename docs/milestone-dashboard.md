# 🧭 KenPire Milestone Dashboard Capsule  
*“See the Mesh evolve — one milestone at a time.”*

## 🧩 Overview  
This dashboard acts as a **living ledger** for KenPire’s progress.  
Each milestone tag automatically feeds here via the Milestone Logger workflow.

- ✅ Tracks all tagged releases (`v*`)  
- 🧾 Pulls data from `CHANGELOG.md` + `/logs/milestones/`  
- 🧠 Linked to Jarvess’ Notion capsule for visual timeline sync  
- 🧬 Protected by ClauseWitch (tamper-proof watermarking)
